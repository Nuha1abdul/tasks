Category 0 refers to patients who are not diabetic, and Category 1 refers to patients who are diabetic.

	•	Category 0 (Non-diabetic patients): The model achieved a high precision of 98% and a recall of 88%, indicating it is able to accurately classify most non-diabetic patients.
	•	Category 1 (Diabetic patients): The precision is low (37%), which suggests that the model might misclassify a number of diabetic patients. However, it has a good recall of 79%, meaning it can identify most diabetic patients.
